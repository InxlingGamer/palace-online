# Palace Online — project handoff

Living status document for the 2026 audit and overhaul. Keep it current at every checkpoint so any new chat can pick up from here. Read this first, then `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/RULES.md`.

_Last updated: 2026-10-26 — Milestone 2 implemented, reviewed, and committed on its branch; PR awaiting the owner's merge approval. Next: Milestone 3._

## How to resume

1. Check out the active branch listed under **Current state** and run `git -c safe.directory=* status`.
2. Read **Decisions** and **Open questions** before changing anything; never change Palace rules without the owner's approval.
3. Pick up the first task in the tracker that is not `done`.
4. Update this file (status, tracker, findings) before ending a session.

## Working agreements

- Roles: Claude is project manager, architect, design lead, and QA; Codex implements scoped tasks. Claude reviews every Codex diff, runs the tests, and checks rendered screenshots before anything is committed.
- **`main` deploys to production.** `render.yaml` uses `autoDeployTrigger: checksPass` on `main`. All work happens on `overhaul/*` branches with one PR per milestone; merging requires the owner's explicit approval.
- Budget is $0. No paid services, dependencies, or hosting changes without approval. Do not migrate off Render without approval.
- Players: two people (the owner and one partner). Priority devices: desktop and **iPhone 15 Plus Safari, portrait**. No real-device testing service; use Playwright WebKit emulation and list what remains unverified.

## Local tooling quirks (Windows)

- The `.git` directory is owned by the Codex sandbox account. Run git as `git -c safe.directory=* <command>`; do not edit global git config without asking.
- `pnpm` is not on `PATH`. Use `corepack pnpm …`. Workspace scripts that call `pnpm` internally (`typecheck`, `dev`, e2e web servers) need a `pnpm` shim on `PATH` (a `pnpm.cmd` containing `@corepack pnpm %*`).
- If `node_modules` looks broken, reinstall with `CI=true corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- Playwright Chromium and WebKit are installed (`./node_modules/.bin/playwright install webkit chromium`).
- Codex runs via the Claude Code `codex` plugin (`codex-companion.mjs task --write --fresh --cwd <repo> --prompt-file <file>`). Tell Codex to use `corepack pnpm exec <bin>` and not to run git or `pnpm install`.

## Current state

- Active branch: `overhaul/m2-multiplayer-reliability` (from `main` @ `eb15690`).
- Milestone 1 (audit) is complete and approved. Milestone 2 is implemented (Codex), reviewed and amended (Claude), and committed on the branch. Merging the PR deploys to production, so wait for the owner's approval.
- Verification for M2: 65/65 Vitest tests (3 consecutive runs), 4/4 typechecks, ESLint, Prettier; Playwright 12/12 (desktop Chromium, desktop WebKit, iPhone 15 Plus WebKit portrait and landscape) including a new simultaneous-draw test; scenario suites 9/9. The original reproduction now accepts simultaneous draws, a play racing an opponent draw, and double draws.
- Baseline before M2: 43 unit/integration tests.
- Next step: Milestone 3 (pick up anytime; final-card reveal), on a new branch cut from the M2 branch (or from `main` once M2 is merged).

## Key audit findings (summary)

- **Network mismatch (root cause, reproduced):** the red toast is `STALE_STATE`. The server rejected any action whose `expectedRevision` differed from the room revision, and the revision changes on every draw (either player may draw at any time) and on every connect/disconnect. Simultaneous draws, a play racing the opponent's draw, double taps, and opponent reconnects all caused false rejections. Game state was never corrupted (Codex simulated 200 games / ~49k actions: 52 cards conserved).
- **P0 crashes (reproduced by Codex):** a non-function acknowledgement argument and LEAVE_ROOM followed by reconnect both throw uncaught exceptions and kill the Node process (ending every game).
- **Lifecycle:** a 120-second disconnect (an iPhone screen lock) expired lobby/setup rooms and turned finished games into `expired`, erasing the winner; a both-disconnected sequence could skip a forfeit deadline and stall a game.
- **Mobile:** with 20 cards, 10 are off-screen on an iPhone 15 Plus viewport (17 of 26); the hand sits under the action dock; large hands overflow on desktop too. About 40% of the mobile table is empty space.
- **UI:** error toasts never auto-dismiss and remain behind the result screen; the lobby shows "You · Out"; the connection indicator is hidden on mobile; hover styles are not gated to hover-capable devices (suspected sticky hover on iOS).
- **Hosting:** Render free is acceptable; the mismatch was not hosting-related. Costs: ~1-minute cold start after 15 idle minutes and occasional restarts that end in-memory games. Alternatives reviewed 2026-10-26: Koyeb free (one 0.1 vCPU/512 MB instance, 1-hour idle sleep, 1–5 s wake) as fallback; Cloudflare Durable Objects (robust but a server rewrite); Oracle Always Free (reported 2026 cuts, idle reclamation); Fly.io/Vercel/Netlify unsuitable or not free.

## Decisions

- Design: full redesign to a classic green felt table; the join screen must keep working.
- Sound effects on by default.
- Conflict policy: only turn-changing actions are checked against a turn sequence; draws, ready, setup, rematch, and leave are validated by the engine without a revision precondition.
- Legacy clients (no `expectedTurn`) keep the old strict revision check for turn actions.
- Owner answers, 2026-10-26:
  1. **Pick up anytime, regardless of whose turn it is** (M3). Interpretation to implement: allowed whenever the pile is non-empty and play is active, even with a legal move. On your own turn it ends your turn as today; off-turn it leaves the turn unchanged and consumes any seven restriction targeting you. Blocked only while a seven direction choice is pending (it resolves in a moment). An off-turn pickup changes the pile, so it bumps `turnSeq`; a play racing it gets the neutral "table changed" notice.
  2. **Final-card reveal approved** (M3): show the last played card (even if it burned the pile) for ~1.5 s before WINNER/LOSER. Requires the server to expose the last play in the projection.
  3. **Large hands: a single sideways-scrolling hand, sorted as today** (M5), not rank stacks. Requirements: readable card corners at every size, momentum scroll with tap-vs-swipe disambiguation, no page scroll/zoom conflicts, selected cards stay visible, edge fade hints, nothing hidden under the action dock.
  4. **Stay on Render** and add a cold-start "waking the table" screen (M6).
  5. **Lengthen the in-play forfeit grace** to 10 minutes (`RECONNECT_GRACE_MS=600000` in config default, `.env.example`, and `render.yaml`) — part of M2.

## Open questions for the owner

None right now.

## Verification status and unverified areas

- Not verified on a physical iPhone: Safari toolbar resizing, sticky hover, touch latency, audio unlock. Emulation used: Playwright WebKit with the `iPhone 15 Plus` device profile (430×739).
- Audit screenshots live in `output/audit/shots/` (gitignored, local only); the harness is `output/audit/shots.ts`.
